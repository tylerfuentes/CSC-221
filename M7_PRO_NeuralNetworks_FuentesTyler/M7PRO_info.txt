This folder is a cumulative work in progress on the creation of neural networks. The entirety of the reference material can be found 
in the selected works of Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukiela:

Neural Networks from Scratch in Python | Building Neural Networks in Raw Python

This book provides a step by step tutorial on the implementation of this code and explanations of their execution.
All of the code presented in these files has been typed out by hand and executed until a successful product has been executed. 
Errors, and how I resolved them will be included in the files as I become more proficient, not only with building neural networks but, 
with executing programs in iPython as well. iPython will be the primary means of execution until a more meaningful development environment
is introduced.

Each file name will match, not necessarily the chapter but, the section of code it most closely represents 
as new data and new topics are introduced. This is a living document and will be updated as progress is made.

The code in this folder consists of book work completed from pages 1-71 of the textbook:

Neural Networks from Scratch in Python | Building Neural Networks in Raw Python
